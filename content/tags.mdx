# Tags

Tags are a collection of data elements, providers, qualification criteria, and privacy settings. The Tags are used to build simplified data points and analyze and monitor the data in real-time to ease the marketing processes. You can use the code snippet or MediaPixel to configure the data, send data to providers, and simplify the marketing processes.
The two types of Tag Management Solution are Server-side Tagging solution and Browser/Client-side Tagging solution.

## Server-side Tagging

In Server-side Tagging, the events are sent to Ingest Labs and based on the events and configuration of tags, the respective tags are triggered. The server-side tagging includes the same capabilities as per the marketing needs of the server-side ecosystem. You can collect the data in a first-party consented manner for better control over data collection and transfer the high-performance tag management and streaming to the customer. All integrations are performed using MagicPixel UI platform only. 

## Client-side Tagging 

In Client-side tagging, events are not sent to the server and all tasks are performed on the client directly. The tags are triggered on the browser or client website and not sent to the server. Ingest Labs collects the tag information and reports triggered through the SDK on the client website. However, the actual tags are triggered on the client.
