# Configuration of Alarms

You can configure one or both of these alarms:

- Tag Anomaly Detection Alarm: To notify contacts when tag anomalies occur.
- Tag Expiration Alarm: To notify contacts when a tag expires.

In Ingest Labs, you can create an alarm for tag expiration and anomaly detection. The configured contacts will receive an alert when an abnormal tag trigger is detected or when a tag expires. You can also set an advance notification for tag expiry using the **Tag Expiry Look Back** feature.
