# Data Element Version

Every Data Element includes a version number on the top right corner of the screen. Once the Data Element is published, the Version is set to 1. That is Version 1. 
After subsequent edits and only after publishing, the version number keeps on updating to the latest version such as Version 2, version 3, and so on.

**Note**: For the default Data Elements, the version is always set to “1” because these are populated from the template.
Until the Data Element is published, the status displays as **Pending Publish**. Once the Data Element is Published, the status is updated as **Production**.
