# Configuration of Tags

You can add a tag using any of the following options:

- **Browser**: For the conventional method of tagging using the browser.

- **Server**: For backward compatibility and support to create new tags on the server.

In Ingest Labs, you can create media tags for client-side and server-side seamlessly and quickly using the following steps. For browser-side tagging creation, the conventional method of tagging is applicable.

The following elements are mandatory to add a new tag:

| Tag Elements      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Providers   | The Provider acts as a template to define the attributes on a high-level, before configuring the tag. You can select any of the available provider templates, set the attributes, save the provider template, and then configure the tag. <br /> **Note**: If the default provider templates are unavailable, you can create a custom-defined template using the Providers option on the left navigation panel.|
| Data Elements   | The Data elements refer to the data points that are sent to the Provider to populate the values while configuring the tag.      |
| Triggers   | The Triggers indicate when a particular tag is to be triggered based on the data inputs. The triggers are associated with different actions and events while performing the tasks under tags.|
| Qualification Criteria | The Qualification criteria refer to the rules and conditions required to trigger a tag for a particular scenario. You must set the rules when the tags are to be triggered for different scenarios and send the data to the data endpoints.|
