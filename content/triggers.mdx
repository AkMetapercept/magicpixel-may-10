# Triggers

The Triggers indicate when a particular tag is to be triggered based on the data inputs. The triggers are associated with different actions and events while performing the tasks. Some of the examples for triggers include Product View, View cart, Add to cart, View price, View item, View Payment, and so on. Also, the Qualification Criteria provides the additional criteria to indicate more specific instances of when the tag must be triggered. While the Triggers are mandatory, Qualification Criteria is optional.
