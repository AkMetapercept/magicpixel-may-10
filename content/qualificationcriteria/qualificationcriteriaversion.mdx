# Qualification Criteria Version

Every Qualification Criteria includes a version number on the top right corner of the screen. Once the Qualification Criteria is published, the Version is set to 1. That is Version 1. 
After subsequent edits and only after publishing, the version number keeps on updating to the latest version such as Version 2, version 3, and so on.

**Note**: Until the Qualification Criteria is published, the status displays as **Pending Publish**. Once the Qualification Criteria is Published, the status is updated as **Production**.
