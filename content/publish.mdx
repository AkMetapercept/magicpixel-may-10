The **Publish** option provides an overview of all the tags that are present on the Ingest Labs application. Any tag that is created in Ingest Labs includes the following stages:

- **Pending Publish**: A newly created tag appears with a "Pending Publish" status. 

- **Staging**: Before any tag can be published to "Production" it has to be first published to "Staging".

- **Production**: Once the tag is published to Staging, it can be then published to "Production".
