# View Data Governance Timeline

Once the Provider status is updated, you can view all the changes that are performed on the client-side. The Data Governance Timeline screen lists all the providers that are updated from Allowed to Blocked or Blocked to Allowed.

**Note:** Whenever a provider status is modified from **Allowed** to **Blocked** or **Blocked** to **Allowed** under Data Governance, even the Provider section is modified with the changes. You must also ensure to navigate to the Publish section and publish the provider status of the respective provider.
