Once the Provider status is updated, you can view all the client-side changes. The Data Governance Timeline screen lists all the providers updated from Allowed to Blocked or Blocked to Allowed.

**Note:** Whenever a provider status is modified from **Allowed** to **Blocked** or **Blocked** to **Allowed** under Data Governance, the Provider section is also modified with the changes. You must also ensure to navigate to the Publish section and publish the provider status of the respective provider.
