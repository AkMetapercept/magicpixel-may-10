The Data Governance screen lists all the providers configured in a particular project.

Each providers displays the status as **Allowed** or **Blocked** in the right corner. 
When you create a new project, all providers are initially set to Allowed by default. 

Ingest Labs blocks or allows the triggering of tags based on the following conditions:

- User consent 
- Provider settings

The following table lists the two scenarios while triggering the tags.

| Status      | pr_comp | provider_block_list | Trigger Tags |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------|-------------|
| User provides data tracking consent    | True   | Allowed | Yes |
| User provides data tracking consent   | True   | Blocked | Yes |
| User denies data tracking consent | False | Allowed | Yes |
| User denies data tracking consent | False | Blocked | No |

- The Providers in the **Allowed** state are allowed despite the value of pr_comp.
- The Providers in the **Blocked** state are allowed only when the pr_comp = True.
