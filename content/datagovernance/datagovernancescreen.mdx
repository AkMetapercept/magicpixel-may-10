Each of these providers display the status as **Allowed** or **Blocked** on the right corner. 

By default, all the providers are marked with Allowed status whenever a new project is created.

Magic Pixel blocks or allows the triggering of tags based on the following conditions:
- User consent received
- Provider settings

The following table lists the two scenarios while triggering the tags.

| Status      | pr_comp | provider_block_list | Trigger Tags |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------|-------------|
| User has provided consent for data tracking   | True   | Allowed | Yes |
| User has provided consent for data tracking   | True   | Blocked | Yes |
| User has not provided consent for data tracking | False | Allowed | Yes |
| User has not provided consent for data tracking | False | Blocked | No |

- The Providers in the **Allowed** state are allowed no matter is the value of pr_comp.
- The Providers in the **Blocked** state are allowed only when the pr_comp = True.
