# Reports

The Reports module displays the details similar to the Dashboard. However, there is no visualization of data unlike Dashboards. You can display reports either for the Staging or Production environment.

Although in Live Debugging and Dashboards the tag details are available, the Reports data is mainly used to debug errors. The debug details include information about all tags triggered during a session and how many times a particular tag is triggered along with the metrics used for data analysis purposes. Furthermore, Reports are the main source of data to troubleshoot errors or missing information at the tag level, provider level, transformation function, configuration issue, or missing attributes, due to which tag failures might occur.
